# Range and IQR 

The Range and IQR are units for measure the spread of a dataset.


## Range 

If we have to find the Range of the dataset,
find the minimum and maximum value from the following dataset,
and subtract it whenever the result is your Range. 

## IQR ( Interquartile Range)

- Condition 1 ODD Number of Dataset :

    - We have to sort the data from the dataset.

    - Find the exact middle value.

    - Assume an example we 7 numbers of dataset  such as x =  { 1, 1,  2, 3, 4, 6,  7 }

    - Now we have to find the middle value from the following which is 3.

    - 6-1 = 5 So the IQR for the following dataset is 5 suppose we got pairs after parts 2,2 and 3,4 to both sides we just have to find the median from the same. such as 2, 3.5, and add it which is 5.5 

- Condition 2 EVEN Number of Dataset :

    - Sort the data 

    - Find the Middle value suppose we have 6 numbers of data such as the x = { 1,2,3,3,4,5 }.

    - Once we divided it into two equal parts we get 2 as the first middle part for the left-hand side and 4 for the right-hand side now we subtract it from 4- 2 which is the 2, Hence the IQR for the following data set is the 2.
