## Mesure of central tendency

--------------------------------

### Mean

In Genral **Mean** is nothing but the **Avarage** of the data

![ Mean ](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/66c77a2dae0af5783281635d538f0fde9b807589 "Mean Formula.")

For example, if the monthly salaries of 10 10 employees are { 2500 , 2700 , 2400 , 2300 , 2550 , 2650 , 2750 , 2450 , 2600 , 2400 }

Addition of the Data  we have Divided by Number of Observations.

### Mode

The mode is method to find the catogaries in the dataset
Suppose we have a dataset with two categories such as Rose and Lilly
and the frequency of the each catogary is nothing but the Mode

### Median

As we know about the Mean same like that but minor difference between the mean and median is that the median is more accurate than the mean if we have Outlier values in the dataset

### Skewness

**Skewness** is a measure of the asymmetry of the probability distribution of a real-valued random variable about its mean. The skewness value can be positive, zero, negative, or undefined.
