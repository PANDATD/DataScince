## What is Stats ?

```Stats is the scince of better orgnising and analysing the data.```

## Why we are using the stats ?

```For the better duscion making .```

Now, we know that the what is stats and why is used.
But it has two different Types such as.

- **Discreptive { Organising, Summarizing}**
- **Infrancial {Conclusion on the data we have }**

## What is data ?

It is fact of informetion that can be measured . it can be any.

```
age = { 1,2,3,4,5,6,6,7,8 } 
age is variable .

```

## What is variable ?

A variable is the contanier which can holds the data .
Or we can say variable is property which can take any property.

Now we will deeply look inside the Discreptive stats.
Inside this we want to know about the more folowing.

1. **Populetion (N)**
2. **Samples (n)**

There are so many ways for taking the samples.

- Random .
- Stratified / Layered / Strata .
- Systmatic .
- Conviniant .  

# Variables

- Quantitive Variable (That can be measured numrical ,Ages)

- Qualitetevive / Cato gorial variable (color's , IQ)

- Quantitetevie variable has 2 types :
- Discreat (Whole no, a/c no)
