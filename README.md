# Introducation to Stats for the Data Scince 



## What is Stats ? 
``` Stats is the scince of better orgnising and analysing the data.  ```

## Why we are using the stats ?
```For the better duscion making . ``` 

Now, we know that the what is stats and why is used.<br> 
But it has two different Types such as.
- **Discreptive { Organising, Summarizing}**
- **Infrancial {Conclusion on the data we have }**

## What is data ?
It is fact of informetion that can be measured . it can be any. 

``` 
age = { 1,2,3,4,5,6,6,7,8 } 
age is variable .
and inside the curly braces is the data.
``` 
## What is variable ?
A variable is the contanier which can holds the data .<br>
Or we can say variable is property which can take any property.

Now we will deeply look inside the Discreptive stats.<br>
Inside this we want to know about the more folowing.

1. **Populetion (N)** 
2. **Samples (n)**

There are so many ways for taking the samples. 
- Random . 
- Stratified / Layered / Strata .
- Systmatic . 
- Conviniant .  

# Variables 
- Quantitive Variable (That can be measured numrical ,Ages)
- Qualitetevive / Cato gorial variable (color's , IQ) 

- Quantitetevie variable has 2 types : 
	- Discreat (Whole no, a/c no)
	- Continious (Float, hight)

# Variable Masurment Scale :

## There are 2 typess of variable 
	1. Nominal data {Catagorial data } -> colors .
	2. Ordinal data {The order matters but not value } -> for eg we have following eg.
		marks  rank 
		100		1
		96		2	
		50		3

		In this case the rank matters but not value . 
	3. Interval data {Range} in range 

# Frequency Distrobution :

	sample data = {
		rose, lily, sunflower, rose , lily, rose
	} 

	|flower  |frequency  |cumilitive frequency|  
	------------------------------------------
	|Rose 	   |3			|3|
	|lily 	   |2			|5|
	|sunflower |1 			|6|
